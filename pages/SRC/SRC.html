              improvisation utilizing frame parts that we had at hand. As a result, 
              many aspects were not optimized. They thus were prone to experiencing 
              many errors (band tension loosening over time, the plane getting stuck 
              during launch, the plane falling out in the case of any sudden robot 
              movements, etc.).

                To improve this design, I decided to start from scratch. 
                I was aware of many existing mechanisms that already exist 
                (such as those found on a crossbow). However, I did not want to base my design 
                on existing creations as that may cause me to exhibit convergent thinking 
                rather than divergent thinking, which was needed in order to brainstorm and create 
                something suitable for our task. Though it ended up having similarities to 
                the mechanism of a crossbow, it is far more suited for our own objectives.
                <br>
                <br>
                The process began by visualizing mechanisms and drawing them (I unfortunately did not take any photos). 
                I then selected what I believed to be most applicable and efficient for launching a plane. 
                Afterward, I spent countless hours creating the overall launcher on the CAD software Fusion 360. 
                During this process, I had to constantly consider how to split up the launcher in order to allow for modularity 
                and proper 3D printing and how to integrate it with our robot as a whole. After finally finishing the model, 
                I printed out the parts and assembled it.

                As the printer struggled to produce the pieces to the exact specifications I desired, the final version comprised of
                parts of different filament colors, had additional improvisations, and was generally flimsy. Improvisations include 
                the drilling of additional holes to allow for the addition of limbs for the elastic material. At the very least, the 
                mechanisms work as intended, allowing for this first prototype to be efficiently loaded and taken apart while also ensuring
                precision and ease of use.
