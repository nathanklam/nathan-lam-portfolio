                  The FIRST Tech Challenge is an annual robotics competition held by FIRST (For the Inspiration and Recognition
                  of Science and Technology). Each year, there is a new theme and field design for teams to design robots and create programs for.
                  The competitors range from 7th to 12th grade.

                  points is to launch a paper airplane, so I dedicated much of my time in the second half of the season designing and producing the 
                  launching mechanism.

                  Team IFC #15157 (Invicta Ferro Canibus, Latin for Invicible Iron Dogs) was founded in 2018. I have joined in the 2020-2021 season
                  and mainly served as the Engineering Notebook editor due to the contraints imposed by the Covid-19 lockdown. Since the 2021-2022 season,
                  I began to serve as one of the lead fabricators of the robot. In that role, I planned, designed, and built the robot and 
                  its mechanisms alongside my teammates. Starting in the 2022-2023 season, I also began to specialize in CAD, allowing me to plan the robot 
                  with the help of the software Fusion 360 while providing excellent resources for our documentation. In my final year, I was elected Vice President,
                  but even without that title, I have always led some aspect of the team the entire time I was a member.

            <p class="pbsection-body">Our initial design was a makeshift 
              improvisation utilizing frame parts that we had at hand. As a result, 
              many aspects were not optimized. They thus were prone to experiencing 
              many errors (band tension loosening over time, the plane getting stuck 
              during launch, the plane falling out in the case of any sudden robot 
              movements, etc.).

              <p class="pbsection-body">
                To improve this design, I decided to start from scratch. 
                I was aware of many existing mechanisms that already exist 
                (such as those found on a crossbow). However, I did not want to base my design 
                on existing creations as that may cause me to exhibit convergent thinking 
                rather than divergent thinking, which was needed in order to brainstorm and create 
                something suitable for our task. Though it ended up having similarities to 
                the mechanism of a crossbow, it is far more suited for our own objectives.
                <br>
                <br>
                The process began by visualizing mechanisms and drawing them (I unfortunately did not take any photos). 
                I then selected what I believed to be most applicable and efficient for launching a plane. 
                Afterward, I spent countless hours creating the overall launcher on the CAD software Fusion 360. 
                During this process, I had to constantly consider how to split up the launcher in order to allow for modularity 
                and proper 3D printing and how to integrate it with our robot as a whole. After finally finishing the model, 
                I printed out the parts and assembled it.

                As the printer struggled to produce the pieces to the exact specifications I desired, the final version comprised of
                parts of different filament colors, had additional improvisations, and was generally flimsy. Improvisations include 
                the drilling of additional holes to allow for the addition of limbs for the elastic material. At the very least, the 
                mechanisms work as intended, allowing for this first prototype to be efficiently loaded and taken apart while also ensuring
                precision and ease of use.

            <p class="pbsection-body">Overall, the plane launcher (despite precision errors caused by the 3D printer) 
              works as intended. It was consistent in launching the planes and easy to work with. However, I discovered 
              that over the many hours I spent developing the launcher, the robot was also heavily iterated upon by my 
              teammates; far more than I had expected. As a result, the launcher was not utilized on the robot as the 
              only place it would fit would result in the robot being taller than we desired. The launcher was suitable 
              for the robot weeks prior, not the robot of the current time. What I have learned as a result of this venture 
              is that focusing on a smaller part is certainly an important part of engineering, but it is also important to 
              step back occasionally in order to observe the overall system to ensure that my time spent on my part would 
              integrate well with the final product.
